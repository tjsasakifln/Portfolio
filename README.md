## 🎯 Who I Am

**I'm not a software developer. I'm a systems architect who builds with AI.**

Civil Engineering background shaped by operational reality of public infrastructure and unforgiving deadlines. I bring a unique perspective to automation: **I ignore trends and build only what's transformational**.

I prototype complex systems from zero, directly in CLI environments, using natural language orchestration, domain-specific prompting, and deep research into real user pain points.

**I focus on "applied prompt engineering for systemic leverage"** — because when your stack has constraints, **LLMs aren't toys, they're multipliers**.

## 🔧 What I Build

### 🏗️ **AI Infrastructure for Real Industries**
- Automated real estate appraisals (Valion) 
- Compliance-driven technical reports (ETP Express)
- I use AI not to prototype ideas, but to **reconstruct industry standards**

### 🎭 **Vibe Coding as Architecture**
I operate as a "vibe coder" in Karpathy's definition: **focusing on the *what*, not the *how***.

All projects driven by: pain-point immersion → prompt systematization → CLI-first orchestration using Gemini CLI, Aider, Claude Code, Make.com.

### 🤖 **Agentic Workflows with Measurable ROI**
My bots don't chat. **They replace entire workflows**.

**Example**: WhatsApp message → full technical report → delivered to client → tracked on dashboard.

All orchestrated efficiently. **Pure systemic leverage**.
