## 📍 About Me

I'm not a software developer. I'm a **systems strategist who builds with AI** — a product of the tension between rigorous engineering and radical abstraction.

Trained as a civil engineer and shaped by the operational chaos of public infrastructure and real-world deadlines, I bring a unique lens to automation: one that **ignores what's trending and builds only what's transformative**. I prototype complex systems from zero, directly in CLI environments, using natural language orchestration, domain-specific prompting, and deep research into user pain.

I coined the term "**applied prompt engineering for systemic leverage**" before it was cool — because when your stack has no budget, no team, and no margin for error, **LLMs aren't toys, they're multipliers**.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🧱 **AI Infrastructure for Real-World Sectors**  
  From automated real estate appraisals (Modela Pro / Valion) to compliance-driven technical reports (ETP Express), I use AI not to prototype ideas — but to **reconstruct industry standards**.

- 🕸️ **Vibe Coding as Architecture**  
  I operate as a "vibe coder" in the strictest definition by Karpathy:  
  > *“Focusing on the *what*, not the *how*.”*  
  All my projects are driven by pain-point immersion → prompt systematization → CLI-first orchestration using tools like Gemini CLI, Aider, Claude Code, and Make.com.

- 🤖 **Agentic Workflows with ROI**  
  My bots don't chat. They **replace entire workflows**.  
  Think: one WhatsApp message → full legal report in PDF/Word → sent to client → billed automatically → tracked on dashboard.  
  All orchestrated solo. No dev team. No overhead.

## 🛠️ Stack & Mindset

- **CLI First**: Gemini CLI, Aider, Claude Code, terminal workflows.
- **Low/No-Code Superpowers**: Make, Bubble, Retool, Supabase, Appsmith.
- **Promptcraft**: ReAct, Tree-of-Thought, Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency.
- **Governance & Architecture**: CI/CD, modular design, API-first, scoped MVPs.

I don’t just prompt. I **prompt to deploy**.

## 🌍 The Meta-Vision

> *"The future isn't about writing code — it's about writing systems of intent."*

My goal is to be **undeniably visible to the ecosystem that's building the next 100 years of automation**. Whether you're a VC, CTO, or recruiter, you'll find in my work a rare mix of:

- 🎯 Business-level clarity  
- 🤖 Agentic technical fluency  
- 🛠️ DIY execution  
- 🧭 Strategic compass

## ☎️ Let’s Talk (or Build)

If you're building for the next wave of agentic AI infrastructure — and want someone who prototypes it solo, **then scales it with purpose**, let's talk.
