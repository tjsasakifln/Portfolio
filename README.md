## 🎯 Who I Am

**I'm not a software developer. I'm a systems architect who builds with AI.**

Civil Engineering background shaped by operational reality of public infrastructure and unforgiving deadlines. I bring a unique perspective to automation: **I ignore trends and build only what's transformational**.

I prototype complex systems from zero, directly in CLI environments, using natural language orchestration, domain-specific prompting, and deep research into real user pain points.

**I focus on "applied prompt engineering for systemic leverage"** — because when your stack has constraints, **LLMs aren't toys, they're multipliers**.

## 🔧 What I Build

### 🏗️ **AI Infrastructure for Real Industries**
- Automated real estate appraisals (Modela Pro / Valion) 
- Compliance-driven technical reports (ETP Express)
- I use AI not to prototype ideas, but to **reconstruct industry standards**

### 🎭 **Vibe Coding as Architecture**
I operate as a "vibe coder" in Karpathy's definition: **focusing on the *what*, not the *how***.

All projects driven by: pain-point immersion → prompt systematization → CLI-first orchestration using Gemini CLI, Aider, Claude Code, Make.com.

### 🤖 **Agentic Workflows with Measurable ROI**
My bots don't chat. **They replace entire workflows**.

**Example**: WhatsApp message → full technical report → delivered to client → tracked on dashboard.

All orchestrated efficiently. **Pure systemic leverage**.

## 🚀 Systems I Develop

### 🏗️ **Industry-Specific AI Infrastructure**
**Real Estate & Construction**: Automated valuation systems, technical compliance reports, and regulatory documentation that meet industry standards. Each system replaces manual processes with intelligent workflows.

### 📊 **Business Process Automation**
**End-to-End Workflows**: From lead capture to client delivery, I build systems that handle entire business processes. WhatsApp integration, automated reporting, CRM synchronization, and client communication — all orchestrated seamlessly.

### 🤖 **Agentic Decision Systems**
**Intelligent Agents**: Not chatbots, but specialized agents that make decisions, process complex information, and execute multi-step business logic. These systems operate independently while maintaining full auditability.

### 🔧 **CLI-First Architecture**
**Developer-Centric Tools**: Systems built for technical teams who prefer command-line interfaces. Direct integration with existing development workflows, version control, and deployment pipelines.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal

### **CLI-First Approach**
- Gemini CLI, Aider, Claude Code
- Terminal workflows as primary interface
- Command-line orchestration

### **Low/No-Code Integration**
- Make.com, Bubble, Retool, Supabase, Appsmith
- API-first architecture
- Rapid prototyping to production

### **Prompt Engineering Methodologies**
- ReAct, Tree-of-Thought, Chain-of-Thought
- Self-Consistency patterns
- Domain-specific prompt optimization
